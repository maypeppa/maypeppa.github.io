</p>

<p>
如何有效地总结前人经验教训，包括：
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(1) has this been tried unsuccessfully before? 这件事情别人之前是否真的做过？因为有很多公司都是默默无名的。</li>
<li>(2) why did that company fail? 为什么这个公司失败了？原因可能是多方面的，需要收集多种渠道。</li>
<li>(3) am I really different? 我真的是否与众不同？差别是否足够大，是否有证据可以来证明。</li>
</ul>

<p>
2/  As a founder, I heard this dozens of times. It’s likely to come from investors, but you hear it from other founders, potential employees, advisors, customers, even family members. Like it or not, pattern matching is strong.
</p>

<p>
5/  So here’s the thing if you’re a founder hearing “someone tried this before”: <b><b>this isn’t a reason to be discouraged</b></b>
</p>

<p>
6/  Successful companies often look like previously unsuccessful ones, but with a few differences that are only obvious in retrospect.
</p>

<p>
7/  Choose whichever cliche you like best - past is prologue? back to the future? - but it’s undeniable that the future often starts off looking pretty similar to the past. In fact, because consumers favour things they know, this can be a feature, not a bug.
</p>

<p>
11/  ‘Has this been done before’ is hard because most startups fail quietly. It’s not like there is some central repository of failed startup ideas.
</p>

<p>
12/  The ones we tend to hear about in the press are either the huge successes (AirBnB) or the notorious failures (Theranos). 99% of startups end up in the middle.
</p>

<p>
17/  It’s like a Rorschach test for the founder mind. One might say they went after the wrong market. Another might say the product had a fundamental flaw. Another might focus on execution mistakes
</p>

<p>
18/  They’re all probably right in some form or another. You need to continue to push and prod to get to the second and third layer
</p>

<p>
24/  At Frank we made the experience of social lending way better, but we never solved the customer acquisition problem that took down our predecessors. Better product didn’t change that, so our potential was limited.(即便你找出不同之处，可能这些不同之处并不会影响成败)
</p>

<p>
27/  Find the evidence that means your unique twist will help you succeed where others have failed. Give yourself a time limit to find that evidence. If you can't find them, then make them your initial OKRs. Work to prove that in the initial phase of your company.(试图找到你和前人之间真正的差别，如果找不到的话，将它作为初始的OKR来对待)

*** Artificial Curiosity

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aom4RMOHezc

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML
Curiosity is something that all humans exhibit in some way throughout their lives. Recently, a team at Berkeley published a paper on Curiosity driven learning, and they demonstrated how it helped enable their AI agent to learn how to play the popular game Super Mario Brother very efficiently with the added benefit of curiosity to help Mario explore his options. I'll explain how it works in this video using code, animations, math, and the spoken word. This technology can be used to help make our systems more intelligent, and thus our applications more capable of helping other people.

Welcome to my new reinforcement learning course titled Move 37! in this 10 week course we'll go over the basics of reinforcement learning up to modern day techniques that involve neural networks called 'deep' reinforcement learning. In this first video, i'll introduce the idea of a Markov Decision Process. This is the basic mathematical framework for framing the reinforcement learning problem. We'll also briefly mention the ideas of a 'policy' and the agent-environment loop.

Can we actually predict the price of Google stock based on a dataset of price history? I’ll answer that question by building a Python demo that uses an underutilized technique in financial market prediction, reinforcement learning. The specific technique we'll use in this video is a subset of RL called Q learning. Using a combination of code, animations, and theory i'll explain how we can let our AI learn a policy for when to buy and sell google stock to maximize profit. </br></br>Code for this video:</br>https://github.com/llSourcell/Reinforcement_Learning_for_Stock_Prediction</br></br>Please Subscribe!

Deepmind released a paper just a few days ago describing a module for neural networks called the Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU). Although deep neural networks can learn to represent and manipulate numerical information, they don't generalize well outside of the range of numbers encountered during training.  Meaning train it on the numbers 1-10 and it won't be able to count to 11. To improve this ability, the researchers created an architecture that represents numerical quantities as linear activations which are manipulated using primitive arithmetic operators, controlled by learned gates. Its really fascinating stuff, i'll detail how it works in this video. </br></br>Code for this video:</br>https://github.com/llSourcell/Neural_Arithmetic_Logic_Units</br></br>Please Subscribe!

That means fast implementations that can outperform preexisting models in other languages, including even (gasp) Python. It’s a useful skill to know and in this live stream I’ll use C and C-based Python tools like Cython + spaCy to develop some really fast natural language processing algorithms for text data. We’ll be able to tokenize, tag, normalize, vectorize, and dependency parse articles of text to derive valuable insights.

Can AI be used to detect various diseases from a simple body scan? Yes! Normally, doctors train for years to do this and the error rate is still relatively high. From mammograms to cat scans, AI can diagnose a disease better than any human can if given the right training dataset. This will drastically reduce patient death, save medical practices a lot of money, and aid doctors in the patient care process. Everyone will win and its important to remember that AI won't replace doctors, it will become the most powerful tool they've ever used. And once enough AI startups start impacting the field of healthcare, it will become as common a tool as the stethoscope has been. </br></br>Code for this video:</br>https://github.com/llSourcell/AI_in_Medicine_Clinical_Imaging_Classification</br></br>Please Subscribe!

Every product in your home is there as a result of being distributed across whats called a supply chain. The path that a commodity takes through manufacturing, transport, distribution centers, etc. is called the supply chain. The supply chain for most companies is riddled with inefficiencies. Late drivers, bad weather conditions, suboptimal planning, timing issues, the list of things that can go wrong is endless and most of this coordination is done by humans. AI can be used to optimize this entire pipeline, from planning to autonomous transport.

A Chinese scientist recently claimed to have created the first genetically modified human embryos. Using a technology called CRISPR, he made twin baby girls resistant to HIV before they were born. This opened up serious debate across the world on the implications of this technology. I'm going to take this opportunity to give an in-depth analysis of biotechnology, and and answer some really hard questions. Can we really program biology, and if so how? What are the implications of designer babies? Should humans live forever? I really put my heart into this video, I hope you find it useful and inspiring.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVsIHCTGjsE

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML
Peer to peer chat without using a server? We can do this using Ethereum's whisper library. This is a chat protocol that lets nodes chat with each other directly, no need for a central server. It doesn't even use a centralized routing source to let nodes discover each other like BitTorrent does with trackers, instead it uses a distributed hash table as a tool for decentralized peer discovery. Yes its not completely real-time, but the trade-off allows for true private chat. I'm going to explain how it works and code the demo at the end. </br></br>Code for this video:</br>https://github.com/llSourcell/Decentralized_Chat</br></br>Please Subscribe! And like. And comment.

Its an accelerated learning plan, something i'd create for myself if I were to get started today, but I'm going to open source it for you guys. This curriculum will cover all the math concepts, the machine learning theory, and the deep learning theory to get you up to speed with the field as fast as possible.

*** How Does Monero Work?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbHqvr4ffo

#+BEGIN_EXPORT HTML
Monero is a cryptocurrency that enables private transactions. That means the sender, receiver, and transaction amount are not publicly viewable, unlike Bitcoin's blockchain. Monero's transactions stay private using the technology of ring signatures, ringCT, stealth addresses, and I2P routing. I'll explain how all of this works in this video. I do not condone the use of this technology for illegal transactions. This is powerful stuff, ideally, we start using this as a stepping stone towards a world where we get paid for our transactional data (and all the rest of our data). </br></br>You'll find the jupyter notebook for this video and the associated code that I demo in the github link below.  </br></br>Code for this video:</br>https://github.com/llSourcell/how_does_monero_work</br></br>More learning resources:</br>https://getmonero.org/</br>https://github.com/monero-project/monero</br>https://www.monero.how/tutorial-how-to-use-the-monero-gui-wallet</br>https://www.monero.how/tutorial-how-to-mine-monero</br>https://99bitcoins.com/beginners-guide-to-monero/</br></br>Please Subscribe!

Welcome to Fresh Machine Learning! This is my new course dedicated to making bleeding edge machine learning accessible to developers everywhere. </br></br>The demo code for this video is a handwritten character classifier in Python using a One-Shot Learning technique with SciPy: </br></br>https://github.com/llSourcell/One-Shot-Learning-Demo</br></br>I created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:</br>https://wizards.herokuapp.com/</br></br>I introduce two papers in this video</br></br>Human Level Concept Learning through Probabilistic Program Induction:</br></br>http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Science-2015-Lake-1332-8.pdf</br></br>and it's associated code is in MatLab:</br></br>https://github.com/brendenlake/BPL</br></br>but Matlab requires $ to download and Python is better suited for building production apps. I found a great alternative though, these guys are really close to finishing this python library. It's called 'PyBPL' they are working on making the results from the paper generalized so that you can apply BPL to any kind of example dataset.

This episode of Fresh Machine Learning is all about a relatively new concept called a Generative Adversarial Network. A model continuously tries to fool another model, until it can do so with ease.
